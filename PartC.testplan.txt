A more concise and simplified test plan:

Test Plan for "s-chat" Program

1. Socket and Network Testing
- Verify socket creation and binding.
- Test sending and receiving data over the socket.
- Check handling of boundary values for port numbers.
- Ensure compatibility with different operating systems and network environments.
- Perform network testing with multiple clients.

2. Thread and Process Testing
- Confirm successful creation of threads (e.g., "send_messages," "receive_messages").
- Verify threads can interact and communicate as expected.
- Test the "keyboard_input" thread's ability to read from the keyboard and send input to the "server" thread.

3. Progam functionality testing
- Verify the "server" thread's ability to receive messages from the "keyboard_input" thread and send them to the "send_messages" thread.
- Test that the "send_messages" thread can send messages to the client and that the "receive_messages" thread can receive messages from the client.

4. Load testing
- Test the program's ability to handle multiple client chats back to back.
- Test if they are recieved in the correct sequence.
- Test if the program can handle multiple clients at the same time.
